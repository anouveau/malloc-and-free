# malloc-and-free
In this project, We implemente a memory allocator for the heap of a user-level process.

You will get a myprogram.o, a mem.o and a libmem.so after typing '_make_' to build our program. 

Ensure the work directionary contains the following files:

* makefile
* mymain.c
* mem.c
* mem.h
